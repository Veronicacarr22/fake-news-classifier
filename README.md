# fake-news-classifier

This project classifies news articles as **real** or **fake** using TF-IDF features and two machine learning models: **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.  
It includes visualizations of top adjectives, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

## Data
The dataset is **not included** in this repository due to size limits.  

This project uses Kaggleâ€™s **Fake and Real News Dataset**:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

After downloading:
- Rename `Fake.csv` â†’ `fake.csv`  
- Rename `True.csv` â†’ `real.csv`  
- Place both files in the `data/` folder so the notebook can read them.

If youâ€™re running in Colab with Google Drive, the notebook can also fall back to the authorâ€™s original Drive paths.

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repo **or** click the Colab badge above.  
2. Make sure the dataset files (`fake.csv`, `real.csv`) are in a `data/` folder.  
3. Run all cells to preprocess, train models, and view results.
